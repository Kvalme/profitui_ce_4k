<p class=helpheader>Updates</p>

<p class=helpbody>Use the Updates page to download new versions of your interface files.  Click <b>Check for updates</b> to display a list of available files.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class=paraheader>Skip and Accept</span> If a newer file version is available, the <b>Accept</b> checkbox is checked automatically.  You can exclude a file from the next download by unchecking this box.  If you want to permanently exclude a file from future downloads, check the box in the <b>Skip</b> column.  To accept or skip the entire list, right-click the column and choose from the context menu options.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class=paraheader>Variations</span>Some files have variations that you can choose from.  For example, the Chat window can have top or bottom oriented tabs.  Files with variations will display a <b>gear icon</b> next to the name.  Right-click the gear to choose an option.  When you make a new choice, you will need to download the variation which will replace the current file.</p>

<p class=helptopic>Downloading</p>

<p class=helpbody>When your choices are made in the <b>Accept</b> column, click <b>Update now</b>.  If the button is grayed-out, it will be clickable again in a few moments.  The updater will show progress and any errors in the panel below the list as your files are downloaded.  Older files in your custom UI folder will be replaced by the new versions.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class=paraheader>Download method</span>The utility has two different methods for downloading files from the cloud.  Most players will have good results with the standard download method.  If you find that larger UI files are not downloading properly or at all, you can use the alternate download method.  Click the link at the bottom of the page to switch methods, then try the download again.  The utility will remember your choice between sessions.</p>
