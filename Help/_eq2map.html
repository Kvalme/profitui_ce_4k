<p class=helpheader>EQ2MAP</p>

<p class=helpbody>The Everquest II Modular Atlas Project (<a href="http://maps.eq2interface.com" target="_new">EQ2MAP</a>) is the full-featured, official in-game mapping interface developed and maintained by the <a href="http://maps.eq2interface.com/index.php?action=credits" target="_new">EQ2Interface community team</a>.  The EQ2MAP interface provides hundreds of zone maps, thousands of points of interest (POI) and a convenient search feature to assist in navigating around the EverQuest II game world.  Using the custom mapping system, players can also submit new POIs for inclusion in the gamewide EQ2MAP database.</p>

<p class=helpbody>ProfitUI is 100% compatible with EQ2MAP.  The ProfitUI Utility simplifies the process of installing and maintaining the necessary files.  If you do not yet use EQ2MAP, press <b>Update maps</b> on the EQ2MAP configuration page, and the system will be correctly installed.  If you already use EQ2MAP alongside ProfitUI, this button will apply any new or updated files.</p>

<p class=helpbody>You can optionally check for map updates automatically whenever you open the utility.  On the Settings page, check the appropriate box in the Startup and shutdown section.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class=paraheader>Ignore list</span>Rarely, you will want to use a mapping file that does not come from the map update server.  In cases where you want EQ2MAP to skip over a file when updating, add the file name to the ignore list.  You do not need to include any path information, only the base file name and extension, for example <b>eq2map_filename_ignore.xml</b>.</p>
