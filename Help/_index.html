<p class=helpbody>Welcome to ProfitUI Community Edition, a custom user interface for EverQuest II built from the foundation of the popular ProfitUI interface.  ProfitUI Community Edition receives voluntary, ongoing updates from the EverQuest II players themselves.  The ProfitUI Utility simplifies the process of maintaining the necessary files, and offers several enhancements such as a selection of color themes, EQ2MAP updates, and a variety of convenience settings.</p>

<p class=helpbody>Your continuous use of the custom interface, the download server and the utility app are free for as long as they exist.  To help ensure that the ProfitUI Community Edition server and utility continue to be maintained and available to you, donations are accepted and appreciated.</p>
