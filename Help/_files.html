<p class=helpheader>Files</p>

<p class=helpbody>This page contains the locations of important files.  You can set the location of your custom UI folder, make it the game default, and generate an activity log that can help when diagnosing problems.  If the utility is not working properly, check the various settings on this page for any errors with the files.</p>

<p class=helptopic>Custom UI folder</p>

<p class=helpbody>When you run the utility for the first time, it will locate your game folder from a list of likely locations and fill this in for you, if possible.  Your custom UI folder must be located in the \UI subfolder of your EverQuest II game installation.  If you installed EQ2MAP before installing ProfitUI, it is okay to use EQ2MAP as the custom UI folder.  Click Browse and choose the new location.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class=paraheader>Default UI</span>Although not required, setting a default custom UI for the game is a good idea.  If you log in without specifying a custom UI, the game will load either the default UI or the most recently selected UI (from the /loadui command).</p>

<p class=helpbody>The current default, if there is one, will be shown in parentheses above the Custom UI folder.  You can set the current folder as the game default by clicking the <b>Make this UI the default</b> link.  If you click <b>Stop using this UI as the default</b>, the associated lines in the eq2.ini and eq2_recent.ini configuration files will be removed, and the default game UI will be loaded when you log in.</p>

<p class=helptopic>Activity log</p>

<p class=helpbody>If you turn on the activity log, many of the utility's operations such as downloading new files or changing options will appear as you use them.  This can be helpful in diagnosing problems.</p>
