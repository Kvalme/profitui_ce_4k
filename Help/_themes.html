<p class=helpheader>Themes</p>

<p class=helpbody>Color themes and custom skin choices will appear on this page.  You can choose from Red or Blue default color themes by clicking the <b>Use this theme</b> link.  Reload the game interface (/loadui) or restart the game to use the selected theme.  You can also download more themes from the Updates page.</p>

<p class=helpbody>If you want the utility to use the colors from your selected theme, choose "Game theme colors" from the dropdown on the Settings page.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class="paraheader">Style colors</span>The array of colored boxes on each theme tile represents the colors in the <b>eq2ui_ColorStyles.xml</b> file included with each color theme or custom skin.  They give you a good idea of the overall color scheme for that selection.  A limited number of in-game elements use these colors.  They include character "paperdoll" backgrounds and some menu tree selections.</p>

<p class=helpbody>If you want to experiment with a different color for one of these elements in your <b>current theme</b>, click the associated box and choose a different color.  The ColorStyle file being used by the game (and by the utility if you made that choice on the Settings page) will use the new color the next time you log in.  The experimental choice will remain permanently until you choose a different theme.  ColorStyle changes can be made to any of the custom themes and skins.  Default Red and Blue themes cannot be changed.</p>

<p class=helptopic>Creating a new theme</p>

<p class=helpbody>If you are handy with image editing, you can apply your talents by recoloring the default skin, or creating an all-new skin for use in game.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class="paraheader">Theme files</span>The following files are used in themes.  Their default versions are located in the <span style="white-space:nowrap"><b>EverQuest II\UI\Default\images</b></span> folder.  Your theme can make changes to some or all of the files:
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li><span class=helpbodyli>commonelements.dds</span></li>
<li><span class=helpbodyli>window_elements_generic.dds</span></li>
<li><span class=helpbodyli>window_elements_specific.dds</span></li>
<li><span class=helpbodyli>window_elements_specific_pros.dds</span></li>
<li><span class=helpbodyli>windowelements.dds</span></li>

<li><span class=helpbodyli>icons\icon_transp1.dds</span></li>
<li><span class=helpbodyli>eq2ui_ColorStyles.xml</span></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class="paraheader">Viewing and editing</span>DDS files can be viewed with programs such as IrfanView, and edited in an image editing program such as Photoshop using a DDS plugin extension.  The xml color style file can be viewed and edited with Notepad or any other text editor.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class="paraheader">Theme folder</span>In order for your theme to be recognized in the window utility, the folder must be named <b>Theme_xxx</b> where xxx is a unique identifying string.  You can use existing theme folder names as examples.</p>

<p class=helpbody><span class="paraheader">Style file</span>The <b>eq2ui_ColorStyles.xml</b> file contains color values used for tinting certain UI elements in game, such as menu choices and character "paperdoll" background colors.  These colors are also used to recolor the utility window when selected as the utility theme.  The colors are in #000000 RGB format.  Again, use the existing themes as examples.</p>

<p class=helpbody>There are two additional fields in the style file that display information on the theme's tile in the utility:
<ul>
<li><p class=helpbodyli>ThemeName="Your Theme Title"</p>
<li><p class=helpbodyli>Description="A sentence or two describing the theme.  Make sure it's not too long to fit on the tile."</p>
</ul>
